# PPE Production Enablement

Welcome! This repo is for recording what we've learned about producing and distributing PPE during the first-wave COVID 19 crisis in NYC. See this readme for orientation, and the [wiki](https://github.com/NYCPPE/enablement/wiki) for all the how-to pages.

## Quickstart

 - How to's live in the [wiki](https://github.com/NYCPPE/enablement/wiki)
 - Supporting docs are in the repo
 - Suggestions? [open an issue](https://github.com/NYCPPE/enablement/issues/new)
 - Want to add a new wiki page? Awesome! Open an issue to ask for write access, or just dump your content in an issue and we'll sort it in for you.
 
## Contribution Guidelines

 - **Make wiki pages narrow scoped and task-focused**: see the template in the wiki. Each page should address ONE OR AT MOST TWO specific, actionable, result-oriented goals. Have more things to tell people? Make more wiki pages. 50,000 word pages are overwhelming and unusable.
 - **Add supporting docs to the repo**: not into git? Just attach them to an issue and magic git elves will deal with it.
 - **Got video?** Awesome, but please upload to [youtube | vimeo | whatever], not the repo (too big)
 - **Add your page to the wiki directory**: otherwise it'll get lost.
 - **Not sure you should add your page? Yes, you should.** Best if we all capture everything asap; when in doubt, just add it, or open an issue to discuss.
